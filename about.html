      <h5 class="card-title">About Kritika Katwal Realtor Â®</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Moving can be quite a scary process and no one knows more than Kritika. She has lived her early life in Nepal, then relocated to India and Australia before moving to Atlanta. Although it was challenging to continuously move, she always enjoyed seeing new homes and meeting new people. From her young age she had an interest in reading books. "RICH DAD POOR DAD" by Robert T. Kiyosaki is her all-time favorite. This made it obvious that she meant to be a real estate agent. Her patience, empathy, perceptivity and understanding just confirmed that this was her calling. Kritika is a firm believer in being armed with knowledge. She strives to educate her clients so that they are making informed decisions throughout their real estate process.</p>
